# SSC-Glider-Project

A statistical analysis of oxygen levels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, using glider data from the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC). The goal of the models are to predict subsurface dissolved oxygen concentrations from hydrographic variables and three-dimensional location coordinates, which is used to classify regions as hypoxic, marginally livable or ideal for marine organisms. 

This project was contributed to by Jaiden Dahlke in data cleaning and clustering, Ethan Garrafa in data binning and linear modeling, Izaak Gagnon in non-linear modeling, and Ryan Gunther in GAM modeling and research.
